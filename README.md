# kuiper_mining_expedition
First unity game to learn the engine. Floaty asteroid/flappy bird hybrid to challenge myself with new development situations. Learned tons of interesting features such as single-use and duration based powerups, magnet attraction force, persistent high-score system, trigger and collision management, main and secondary scenes, manual explosion animations, dynamic music, sfx, random object generation, and more!
